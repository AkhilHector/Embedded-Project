Project
========

What actually is it ?
====================
Basically this project is about a mobile controlled semi autonoumous robot.
The direction through which it guides is taken care by the IR Sensor, and 
accordingly it moves.

Semi-Autonomous ?
==================
Yes it is, actually it gives the person who wants to control the direction
where the robot wants to guide as well as having the scope of a autonomous
bot this is a completely functional and tested robot.

DTMF
====
It means Dual tone Mutli Frequency through i have made the bot to be contr-\-lled with the help of a mobile device so your touchpad acts as a guided
controller for this, but not all phones are supported and importantly this
can be connected only to the phones that have 3.5mm jack as the DTMF is 
connected to the Device with the help of 3.5mm jack only
